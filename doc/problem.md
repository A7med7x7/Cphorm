Doctors in Sudan are using old-fashioned paperwork to track and save patient records. This can cause the records to be lost or damaged, and it takes a long time to search through all these problems. Doctors deal with these issues, which takes their precious time that could have been spent saving lives.So, my team and I came upWhy don't we help the doctors?But how?We thought we should provide a safe, easy-to-use platform where they can save, navigate, and manage patients health records with excellent history tracking.The doctor can log in and see all his patients records. They can create new records from scratch or just fill out form templates.He can search with name and filter with age or gender, etc., andThey can update existing records, and the previous record won't be lost but will be added to the patient history. We also plan to add an AI assistant that is aware of the patient's status and history to help the doctor diagnose and give advice.
