old one 



Doctors in Sudan are using old-fashioned paperwork to track and save patient records. This can cause the records to be lost or damaged, and it takes a long time to search through all these problems. Doctors deal with these issues, which takes their precious time that could have been spent saving lives.

So, my team and I came up
why dont we help the docters ?
but how ?

we thought we shoud provide a safe easy to use platform where they can save navigate and manage pationts helth records with exilent history tracking.

docter can log in and see all his pationts recrods 

they can create new records from scretch or just fill form templates

he can search with name and filter with age or gender, etc and

they can update existing recods and the previous recode wont be lost but will be added to pationt history 


we also plan to add an AI assistant that is aware of the pationt status and history  to help the docter dignoses and give advice
